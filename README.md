Definition of problem: 
It’s no secret that students aren’t the wealthiest creatures walking the planet — that’s just 
a fact. They often move for the sake of their future: switching faculties, relocating to 
college, or even moving abroad. With all this change comes a wave of challenges that 
build up over time. Relocating to a new apartment or dorm means dealing with a ton of 
unknowns: 
• Is it far from campus? 
• Is it furnished? 
• Will I be living alone or with roommates? 
• Is the kitchen usable? 
• Is there enough space and storage? 
• And more importantly: How do I afford what I need to live decently?  
The typical student budget doesn’t leave much room for expensive solutions. New 
environments can feel like a challenge, new languages add a barrier to it, and studies 
multiply the stress daily. Everything combined, It’s overwhelming — and I’ve felt it myself. 
On top of that, students are often forced to rely on social media or online marketplaces 
that are flooded with scams, bots, and overpriced listings. Dishonesty and digital noise 
make it hard to know what’s real and sometimes, in a rush, quick decisions are made that 
can cost time, money, or both. Hence, you become the victim of the system. So, what if 
we could change that? The system? What if there was a solution that was simpler, safer, 
more student-friendly — a platform made specifically for people in that situation? One 
that helps us buy, sell, and trade what we need, in a community we can trust? That’s the 
solution I want to build — from one student to another.
